## What is OBJEX?
OBJEX is a "startup" maybe (I don't know, it's early to say). 
Currently, it's a set of experimental IoT projects. Every project has a different name, for example, ORB1T.
The goal of OBJEX is to develop IoT systems/devices.

## PROXIMA-ALPHA

**Elevator pitch**

Smart RGB/RGBCW spotlight for different applications. The compact design makes Proxima Alpha a portable led light.

### What is it?
The compact design makes Proxima Alpha a portable led light. The spotlight has 40 RGB LEDs, one OLED display 0.96" and a USB-C connector.
The brain of this spotlight is the ESP8266. Dimensions of the spotlight: 90 x 60 x 10mm.
This device can be used for many applications:
photography light, disco light and more.

Through the OLED display, you can change some of the operating settings.
Some parameters that you can modify:
- The intensity of red, 255 levels
- The intensity of green, 255 levels
- The intensity of blue, 255 levels
- Brightness
- Preset effects (Fade, strobe, breath)
- Effects and transitions
- Energy profile
- Cloud settings(Support with Firebase, Redis etc.)
- WiFi settings


### Why I made this?
I developed this project because I needed a led spotlight for different uses. Those on the market are too expensive.

### Features

- 40 RGB LEDs WS2812B or 40 RGBCW LEDs SK6812
- USB-C TYPE-2
- OLED Display 0.96"
- 3 buttons
- ESP8266
- OBJEX APP - for remote control

### Issues
Currently the project has no technical problems.

### The future of PROXIMA?
In the future I will continue the project.

**Margins of improvement**

- Battery with charging system
- Add ESP32
- Change the buttons
- Add a variable resistance for brightness control
- Create a case to protect the spotlight
